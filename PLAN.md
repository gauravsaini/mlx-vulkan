# MLX Vulkan Backend — Task Tracker

## Context

Implement a Vulkan compute backend for MLX (ml-explore/mlx) to enable the framework on Linux
with any Vulkan-capable GPU (AMD, NVIDIA, Intel). Mirrors the existing CUDA backend structure.
Target: Linux-first. macOS via MoltenVK deferred. Full primitive coverage. AOT SPIR-V kernels.

**Key contract**: `mlx/backend/gpu/eval.h` — 4 functions all GPU backends must implement:

- `gpu::new_stream(Stream)`, `gpu::eval(array&)`, `gpu::finalize(Stream)`, `gpu::synchronize(Stream)`

**Reference backends**: `mlx/backend/cuda/` (structure), `mlx/backend/metal/` (kernel patterns)

**Current device**: Apple M1 via MoltenVK (macOS development)
**Last verified**: 2026-03-03

**Post-build workflow** (required after any `.cpp` change):

```bash
cmake --build build/temp.macosx-15.0-arm64-cpython-311/mlx.core -j4
cp build/lib.macosx-15.0-arm64-cpython-311/mlx/core.cpython-311-darwin.so python/mlx/
cp build/temp.macosx-15.0-arm64-cpython-311/mlx.core/libmlx.dylib python/mlx/lib/
```

**After any `.comp` shader change**, either:

```bash
glslc --target-env=vulkan1.2 mlx/backend/vulkan/kernels/FOO.comp -o build_vulkan/mlx/backend/vulkan/kernels/FOO.spv
```

or simply run the full `cmake --build build_vulkan -j4` (rebuilds shaders too).

---

## Known Issues / Critical Bugs Fixed

### Fixed (2026-03-03) — Dtype Coverage in copy/arange/binary/divmod shaders

27. **copy.comp missing uint16/int16/int64/uint64** (`kernels/copy.comp`):
    - Added DTYPE_UINT16, INT16 cases to `read_as_float()` (16-bit packed reads) and `write_float()` (atomic 16-bit writes).
    - Added DTYPE_INT64, UINT64 two-word reads and writes for 64-bit types.

28. **arange.comp integer dtype + inf-step NaN guard** (`kernels/arange.comp`):
    - Added `out_dtype` push constant; push size 12 → 16.
    - Integer types (int32/uint32/int64/uint64) now convert start+step to integer first (matches CPU).
    - Float path now guards `isinf(step)` to prevent `0 * inf = NaN`.

29. **binary.comp MoltenVK float(int64) workaround** (`kernels/binary.comp`):
    - `float(int64_t)` returns 0 on MoltenVK; workaround: `float(int(int64_t))`.

30. **binary_two.comp full dtype rewrite for divmod** (`kernels/binary_two.comp`):
    - Rewrote from float[] buffers to uint[] with DTYPE_* dispatch for all dtypes.
    - Added `dtype` push constant; push size 16 → 20.

31. **Pipeline cache version bumped 10 → 12** (`device.cpp`):
    - v11: arange push const size change
    - v12: binary_two push const size change

### Fixed (2026-03-02) — >4D Binary Broadcast Limits & CPU Fallbacks

25. **>4D Binary Broadcast Limit Fixed** (`primitives.cpp`):
    - `binary.comp` push constants only support up to 4 dimensions. Broadcasting or expanding dimensions > 4 resulted in out-of-bounds stride arrays or dimensionality mismatches (like the `test_expand_sums` failure, which produced scalar outputs instead of correct tensors).
    - Fixed `dispatch_binary` in `primitives.cpp`. It now processes `collapse_contiguous_dims` first. If `shape.size() > 4`, it recursively delegates to fully contiguous bounds using `copy_gpu(CopyType::General)`, seamlessly instantiating `a_contig` and `b_contig` buffers before submitting the primitive to the binary shader under the 4D push constant constraints.

26. **CPU Fallbacks for Unsupported Primitives** (`primitives.cpp`):
    - Operations like `Scatter`, `Gather`, `Sort`, `Partition`, `Convolution`, etc., were throwing `std::runtime_error("[vulkan::...] Fallback to eval_cpu is unsupported")` when invoked on the GPU, breaking testing for entire execution branches.
    - Replaced these exceptions across `primitives.cpp` (WIP/partially applied) with synchronized `eval_cpu(inputs, out)` executions. Test graphs that fall back to unsupported GPU primitives can now correctly hand execution back to the CPU execution stream.

### Fixed (2026-02-26)

1. **eval.cpp — SIGSEGV on eval_gpu() deletion**: `eval_gpu()` call was accidentally deleted by a `sed` command. Restored manually. This was the root cause of segfaults during GPU dispatch.

2. **binary.comp — int32 arithmetic corruption on Apple Silicon**: Apple Silicon GPU flushes denormals-to-zero, meaning int32 values reinterpreted as float bits via `uintBitsToFloat()` were silently flushed to 0. Fixed by adding dtype-aware arithmetic paths (`DTYPE_FLOAT` / `DTYPE_INT` / `DTYPE_UINT`) so integer ops never pass through float interpretation.

3. **fft.cpp — broken FFT implementation**: Broken `RFFT`/`IRFFT` class names and `is_power_of_2` ambiguity caused compile errors. Replaced with minimal stubs that throw `runtime_error`.

4. **Stale Python extension after rebuild**: `build_vulkan/core.cpython-314-darwin.so` must be manually copied to `python/mlx/` and re-signed with `codesign` after each build — this is not automated by CMake.

### Fixed (2026-02-27) — FFT Implementation

5. **fft.comp — wrong dispatch geometry**: Vulkan was dispatching `vkCmdDispatch(batch_size, threadgroup_batch_size, 1)` with `local_size_x=256`. Metal dispatches 1 workgroup per batch item with `threads_per_fft × tg_batch_size` threads. Fixed: `vkCmdDispatch(batch_size, 1, 1)` with `local_size_x=1024`.

6. **fft.cpp — FFTPushConstants::stockham[8] off-by-one**: `supported_radices = {13,11,8,7,6,5,4,3,2}` has 9 entries. `stockham[8]` (radix-2 steps) was never stored — array was only 8 elements. Fixed: extended to `stockham[9]`, loop limit `i < 9`.

7. **fft_op — encoder.op_count never incremented**: `Device::commit()` returns early if `op_count == 0`. All GPU commands were silently dropped — FFT output was all zeros. Fixed: added `encoder.op_count++` after `vkCmdDispatch`.

8. **fft.comp — radix-8 not implemented**: For n≥512, `plan_stockham_fft` uses radix-8 (e.g. 512=8³). Shader had no radix-8 codelet. Added `radix8()`, `radix_butterfly_8()`, and radix-8 pass loop in `perform_fft`. n=512..4096 now pass.

9. **FFTPushConstants push constant overflow**: Struct was 132 bytes (33×uint32); Vulkan limit is 128 bytes. `real` field at offset 128 was always out-of-bounds → `is_rfft` always false, RFFT loaded complex64 from float32 input. Fixed: removed unused `rader[9]` from struct and GLSL block → struct drops to 96 bytes.

10. **RFFT support**: Added binding 2 (`float src_real[]`) to `fft.comp`. When `params.real==1 && params.inv==0`, loads float input as `vec2(x, 0.0)` and truncates output to `n/2+1`. Removed Metal-specific 2-RFFT batch halving from `fft.cpp`.

### Fixed (2026-02-28) — Gather/Scatter ND + Scan GPU dispatch

11. **Gather::eval_gpu — only handled 1D axis=0**: `mx.take(2D_array, idx, axis=1)` threw "Fallback to eval_cpu is unsupported". Fixed: added INDEX_GATHER_GEN (op=3) to `indexing.comp` — general ND gather using `j = tid / slice_total`, `outer_off = within / inner`, `inner_off = within % inner`, `src_pos = outer_off * src_outer_stride + idx[j] * inner + inner_off`. Now all single-axis gather cases are handled on GPU.

12. **GatherAxis/ScatterAxis push constant size mismatch**: Both functions were calling `get_pipeline("indexing", ..., 3, 32)` with a 9- or 8-field struct, but the shader declared 9 fields = 36 bytes. After the push constant was extended to 11 fields (44 bytes), the 32-byte pipeline layout caused vkCmdPushConstants to be out-of-range. Fixed: unified all three indexing ops to use shared `IndexPushConst` (44 bytes, 11 fields) via `indexing_dispatch()` helper.

13. **MoltenVK stale pipeline cache crash**: After changing the indexing push constant layout from 36→44 bytes, the on-disk pipeline cache (`~/.cache/mlx_vulkan_pipeline_cache.bin`) retained the old binary pipeline. MoltenVK's pipeline cache loader crashed with SIGKILL on dlopen. Fixed: added version suffix to cache path (`mlx_vulkan_pipeline_cache_v2.bin`); bump version whenever push constant layouts change.

14. **ScatterAxis negative-index wrap using wrong field**: `INDEX_SCATTER` was wrapping with `int(params.idx_size)` instead of `int(params.src_ax_size)`. Fixed in `indexing.comp`.

15. **Scan::eval_gpu unconditionally threw**: Prefix scan (cumsum/cumprod) always failed with a runtime_error. Implemented full GPU dispatch via a two-level Hillis-Steele scan in `scan.comp`: serial inclusive scan within each thread's chunk (chunk_size = ceil(scan_size/256)), parallel cross-chunk prefix on stotals[], propagate back, exclusive conversion at writeback. Supports scan_size ≤ 1024; Sum/Prod/Max/Min; inclusive and exclusive; reverse.

### Fixed (2026-02-28) — Binary broadcast stride-based indexing

16. **binary.comp — broadcast arrays caused GPU hang**: Binary shader used flat `idx` for both inputs. For broadcast arrays like `(2,1)` broadcast to `(2,3)`, `data_size=2` but shader indexed `b[0..5]` → OOB GPU hang. Three approaches were tried:

    **Rejected: Modulo indexing (`idx % data_size`)** — Works for scalar (`data_size=1`, `idx%1=0`) and row broadcast (`(1,3)→(2,3)`: `data_size=3`, `idx%3` gives `0,1,2,0,1,2`). Fails for column broadcast (`(2,1)→(2,3)`: `data_size=2`, `idx%2` gives `0,1,0,1,0,1` but correct mapping is `0,0,0,1,1,1`). The issue: simple modulo assumes the broadcast dimension is last, which isn't true for column broadcasts.

    **Rejected: CPU-side `expand_broadcast` via `copy_gpu_inplace`** — Materializes the broadcast by dispatching a General copy shader with zero-stride input strides. The copy itself completed (verified via debug prints), but the subsequent binary shader dispatch hung. Root cause: enqueuing two shader dispatches (copy + binary) within a single `eval_gpu` call on MoltenVK causes a command-buffer-level GPU conflict. This is a MoltenVK-specific issue — commands enqueued at the same depth in the call stack can deadlock.

    **Chosen: Stride-based ND broadcast indexing in-shader** — Push constants expanded 28→80 bytes (within 128-byte limit) with `ndim`, `out_shape[4]`, `a_strides[4]`, `b_strides[4]`. The shader decomposes the flat output index into ND coordinates via `out_shape`, then dots with per-input strides (stride=0 for broadcast dims). This eliminates any pre-copy, handles all broadcast patterns (scalar, row, column, ND) correctly, and is a single shader dispatch matching the existing architecture. The 80-byte push constant is well under Vulkan's 128-byte minimum guarantee. `compute_broadcast_strides()` in `primitives.cpp` computes zero-stride for dims where `in.shape(i)==1`.

17. **Pipeline cache v3→v4**: binary.comp push constant layout changed (28→80 bytes). Bumped `kPipelineCacheVersion` in `device.cpp`. Additionally, the build system (`setup.py build_ext`) does not automatically detect `.comp` shader changes — manual `glslc` recompilation is required after shader edits. This was a contributing factor to debugging difficulty (stale `.spv` cached from Feb 27 was running instead of the modified shader).

### Known Remaining Issues (Test Suite Audit 2026-02-28)

Ran comprehensive test suites `test_array.py` and `test_ops.py`. Results:
- `test_array.py`: 52 PASS, 16 FAIL, 1 HANG (`test_deep_graphs`)
- `test_ops.py`: 41 PASS, 93 FAIL, 0 HANG (Zero GPU deadlocks in ops suite!)
- Total: 93/203 tests pass (46%).

**Failure Patterns to Address Next**:
1. **Missing GPU Primitives**: Ops like `AsStrided`, `Scatter` (multi-axis), `ArgPartition` throw "Fallback to eval_cpu is unsupported".
2. **Reduction correctness**: `test_sum` returns 0 for a non-zero sum, indicating reduction/type conversion issues.
3. **GPU Deadlock**: `test_deep_graphs` causes the only observed hang.

### Fixed (2026-03-01) — Unary Shader Enum Mismatch + float16 Support

18. **unary.comp — enum values off by one for 15/31 operations**: The original `unary.comp` had `UNARY_LOG2=10` inserted after `LOG1P=9`, pushing `Sin=11`, `Cos=12`, etc. — but `primitives.cpp` had `Sin=10`, `Cos=11`, etc. Result: every function from `sin` onward dispatched the *wrong* opcode (e.g. `sin(0.5)` returned `log2(0.5) = -1`). Fixed by rewriting `unary.comp` with constants derived directly from the `UnaryOp` enum in `primitives.cpp`. 15 operations now return correct results.

19. **unary.comp — no float16 support**: Float16 input was interpreted as `float` bits via `uintBitsToFloat()`, producing garbage (e.g. `exp(2.0 f16) = 0.0`). Fixed: added a float16 path in `main()` that uses `unpackHalf2x16()`/`packHalf2x16()` to process two f16 values per thread from a single `uint32` word. push constants now include `input_elem_bytes` so the shader can branch. `exp(2.0 f16) = 7.39` ✅

20. **Log::eval_gpu — log2/log10 had no GPU dispatch**: `unary.comp` received op code `Log2=29` but there was no `Log2::eval_gpu` — only a single `Log` class with a `Base` enum (e, two, ten). Fixed: removed `UNARY_GPU(Log, Log)` macro and replaced with an explicit `Log::eval_gpu` that checks `state()` (the base) and dispatches `UnaryOp::Log`, `UnaryOp::Log2`, or `UnaryOp::Log10`. `log2(0.5) = -1.0` ✅, `log10(0.5) = -0.301` ✅

- Hadamard: Not yet implemented (`kernels/hadamard.comp` stub only).
- Scan: scan_size > 1024 throws (multi-pass GPU scan not yet implemented). LogAddExp variant not on GPU.

### Fixed (2026-03-01) — Thread Safety & Descriptor Pool Stabilization

21. **Device::commit thread safety bug**: Detached background threads in `commit()` were suffering from lambda capture corruption (likely an Apple Clang 15 arm64 ABI issue) leading to `std::bad_function_call`. Fixed by encapsulating state in a heap-allocated `CommitState` struct and adding null-pointer guards for completion handlers.

22. **EXC_BAD_ACCESS in MoltenVK (Descriptor Pool Lifecycle)**: Global `descriptor_pool_` was being reset via `vkResetDescriptorPool` while other streams might still have in-flight command buffers using those descriptor sets. Fixed by moving `VkDescriptorPool` management to the per-stream `CommandEncoder`. Descriptor pools are now created and destroyed alongside command pools in the background commitment thread.

23. **Matmul EXC_BAD_ACCESS on zero-sized dimensions**: Matrix multiplications with `K=0` were causing `vulkan::get_buffer()` to return `VK_NULL_HANDLE` for the empty input tensors. Passing these to `vkUpdateDescriptorSets` triggered a segmentation fault in MoltenVK. Fixed by adding `out.size() == 0` check and currently refining the handling of zero-sized reduction dimensions (K=0).

24. **Stream-aware alloc_descriptor_set**: Updated `alloc_descriptor_set(Stream s, ...)` signature across the backend to ensure shaders always acquire descriptors from the pool associated with their active command encoder. Fixed ~20 compilation errors in `primitives.cpp` related to missing `stream()` context.

### Known Remaining Issues (2026-03-01) — Updated

- **Hanging stages**: Reduce (stage 10), Matmul (stage 11), NN Ops (stage 12), FFT (stage 17),
  Concat (stage 18), Advanced MM (stage 21) — all timeout at 20s. Likely GPU fence/semaphore
  never signals, or command buffer never submits in the test code path.
- **Failing stages**: Sort (stage 14, 0/2), NN Extended (stage 16, 2/4), AddMM/Conv (stage 17, 0/2).
  These regressions vs Feb state — unknown if code changed or test cases changed.
- **fast::Quantize dequantize GPU**: Inline CPU workaround. GPU shader path causes
  `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` when `mx.random.normal` semaphores are pending in the command buffer.
  Root cause: semaphore state inconsistency in `commit()` when called with `has_sems=1` and
  empty op_count. Needs deeper investigation of the command buffer submission path.
- **Memory Tracking**: Background `commit` thread synchronization vs allocator stats — second pass needed.

- [x] `void* Buffer::raw_ptr()` — staging buffer mapped pointer for host access

- [x] `signal(uint64_t value)` — `vkSignalSemaphore`
- [x] `wait(uint64_t value)` — `vkWaitSemaphores` (CPU blocks)
- [x] Integrate with MLX `Event` type: `Event::wait()`, `Event::wait(Stream)`, `Event::signal(Stream)`
- [x] `Event::is_signaled()` — queries `vkGetSemaphoreCounterValue` (fixed from always-true stub)
- [x] CPU-stream `signal(stream)` path — enqueued via `scheduler::enqueue` (matches Metal)
- [x] CPU-stream `wait(stream)` path — enqueued via `scheduler::enqueue` (matches Metal)

### `mlx/backend/vulkan/fence.cpp`

- [x] `FenceImpl` with CPU-side `std::condition_variable` for cross-stream sync

- [x] Fixed `thread_local` caching bug — map now clears/repopulates on each call

---

## Phase 5: GPU Eval Dispatch ✅ COMPLETE

### `mlx/backend/vulkan/eval.cpp` — implements `mlx/backend/gpu/eval.h`

- [x] `gpu::new_stream(Stream stream)` — calls `vulkan::device(...).new_queue(stream.index)`
- [x] `gpu::eval(array& arr)` — full dispatch loop (mirrors `metal/eval.cpp`):
  - Get command buffer for stream
  - Call `arr.primitive().eval_gpu(inputs, outputs)`
  - Track input/output buffer lifetimes

  - Register completion handler → `scheduler::notify_task_completion(s)`

  (all delegate to `eval_cpu()` via unified-memory path; `cpu/encoder.h` fixed for GPU-stream sync;

## Key Technical Decisions

| Decision        | Choice                          | Rationale                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shader language | GLSL 4.60 compute               | Standard, mature tooling, all Vulkan drivers                                      |
| Compilation     | AOT via glslc at build time     | No runtime compiler dep, faster startup                                           |

| bfloat16        | uint16 storage + manual ops     | No native Vulkan bf16 — same approach as metal bf16.h                             |

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate: Unblock test_array.py and test_ops.py

1. Audit `unary.comp` for int32 dtype correctness (same class of bug as binary.comp fix).
2. Implement missing shape/memory primitives: `Concatenate`, `Split`, `Pad`, `NumberOfElements`.
3. Run `test_array.py` suite to completion; log all failures.
4. Run `test_ops.py` suite; identify remaining CPU fallback ops causing failures.

### Phase G: FFT / Hadamard (Spectral Ops) ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] `FFT`, `RFFT`, `IFFT`, `IRFFT` — Stockham Cooley-Tukey radix-2/4/8; 3/3 tests passing.
- [x] `Hadamard` — GPU Walsh-Hadamard Transform in `kernels/hadamard.comp`; butterfly in shared mem; n≤2048 on GPU, larger/non-power-of-2 fall back to `eval_cpu`.
- [ ] Rader/Bluestein for non-power-of-2 FFT sizes — future work.

### Remaining Work (Priority Order) — Updated 2026-03-01

#### Critical — Hanging Stages (GPU deadlock / infinite loop)
These stages timeout after 20s. A hang blocks the entire test suite.

1. **Stage 10 (Reduce)** — `test_stage10_reduce.py` hangs. Root cause unknown; likely command buffer
   never commits or fence never signals in the reduction path.
2. **Stage 11 (Matmul)** — `test_stage11_matmul.py` hangs. Matmul dispatch works in isolation
   (stage 19 passes) but something in the stage 11 test cases causes a hang.
3. **Stage 12 (NN Ops)** — `test_stage12_nn_ops.py` hangs. Likely same class of issue.
4. **Stage 17 FFT** — `test_stage17_fft.py` hangs. Previously passed (3/3 in Feb) — regression.
5. **Stage 18 Concat** — `test_stage18_concat.py` hangs. Concatenate/strided copy issue.
6. **Stage 21 Advanced MM** — `test_stage21_advanced_mm.py` hangs. GatherMM/BlockMaskedMM throws
   should not hang — investigate if the test itself is polling indefinitely.

#### High Priority — Failing Stages (runs, wrong results)
7. **Stage 14 Sort** — 0/2 FAIL. Bitonic sort regression; previously 6/6 in Feb.
8. **Stage 16 NN Extended** — 2/4 FAIL. LayerNorm/RMSNorm/RoPE regression; 2 tests failing.
9. **Stage 17 AddMM/Conv/RBits** — 0/2 FAIL. AddMM or Conv dispatch broken.

#### Medium Priority — Completed, not yet fully wired
10. **GatherMM / BlockMaskedMM / SegmentedMM on GPU stream** — Currently throw (CPU stream works).
    GPU implementation requires dedicated sparse/gather+matmul shader pipeline.
11. **GatherQMM GPU** — Currently throws gracefully; would need gather→dequant→matmul pipeline.

#### Low Priority / Future
12. Rader/Bluestein FFT for non-power-of-2 sizes.
13. Multi-axis Gather/Scatter fully on GPU (currently 1D only).
14. Numerical equivalence test suite (`tests/vulkan_equivalence.py`).
15. Performance baselines vs CPU backend.
16. fast::Quantize dequantize GPU shader path (currently inline CPU; GPU shader caused
    VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST when random semaphores pending).

## Phase 11: Production Readiness (from Architectural Review 2026-03-01)

Gaps identified in REVIEW.md, assessed against current implementation:

### A. JIT Kernel Fusion (`mx.compile()` GPU path)
**Status**: CPU fallback only. `Compiled::eval_gpu` delegates to `eval_cpu`.
**Gap**: True GPU fusion requires runtime SPIR-V generation via `glslang`/`shaderc` JIT.
**Plan**:
- [ ] Implement `Compiled::eval_gpu` with shaderc JIT: fuse elementwise chains into single SPIR-V kernel
- [ ] Cache fused kernels by op-graph hash

### B. Workgroup Tuning for AMD RDNA
**Status**: ✅ Infrastructure COMPLETE. Subgroup size queried at init; M1/MoltenVK = 32/128.
  Shaders still hardcode `local_size_x=256` — specialization constants not yet wired per-shader.
**Plan**:
- [x] Query subgroup size via `VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupProperties` + `vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2`
- [x] Store `subgroup_size_` / `preferred_workgroup_size_` in `VulkanDevice`; exposed in `device_info()`
- [ ] Pass to shaders via `VkSpecializationInfo` per pipeline
- [ ] Tune `matmul.comp` tile size for 64-wide wavefronts (AMD) vs 32-wide (Intel)

### C. Cooperative Vectors / Subgroup Matrix Ops
**Status**: Not implemented.
**Gap**: VK_NV_cooperative_matrix / VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix would allow hardware tensor cores on NVIDIA/AMD.
**Plan**:
- [ ] Check `VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix` availability at device init
- [ ] Implement `matmul.comp` fast path using `coopMatLoad`/`coopMatMulAdd` when available

### D. Distributed Execution
**Status**: All `distributed::` ops are `NO_GPU_MULTI` (throw).
**Gap**: `mx.distributed` requires cross-device/cross-host communication.
**Plan**:
- [ ] Implement `AllReduce` via `vkCmdCopyBuffer` + barrier (single-node, multi-queue)
- [ ] Multi-node: integrate with MPI or NCCL equivalent (future)

### E. ARM AI-ML Layer (reviewed and REJECTED)
The review's sequence diagram depicts this as a callable shader library. **This is incorrect.**
The ARM layer is a Vulkan loader extension (`VK_ARM_data_graph`/`VK_ARM_tensors`), injected
transparently. It is not a library you link against or call functions from. No action required.
**Verdict**: ❌ Not applicable — assessed and documented in External References section.

---

## External References — ARM AI/ML Emulation Layer

**Repo**: `https://github.com/arm/ai-ml-emulation-layer-for-vulkan`

**What it is**: Vulkan layer implementing `VK_ARM_data_graph` + `VK_ARM_tensors` extensions. Injected
by the Vulkan Loader — transparent to apps. Not a linkable compute library.

**Relevance to this project**:

| Aspect | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Direct shader reuse | ❌ No | Only `copy.comp` + utility glsl in `tensor/shaders/` — no ML ops |
| `VK_ARM_tensors` extension | ⚠️ Future | Alternate fast path on ARM Mali; not useful today |
| AOT SPIR-V strategy | ✅ Confirms | ARM uses same AOT approach — validates our architecture |
| MoltenVK variant shaders | ✅ Noted | `tensor_mvk.glsl` confirms MoltenVK needs platform-specific code |
| Direct integration | ❌ No | Extension layer, not a compute library to link |

**Conclusion**: No immediate action. Add `VK_ARM_tensors` as future fast-path ticket in Phase 10.

---

## Phase 5: Shape & Misc Primitives ✅ COMPLETE

### Key findings

- **NumberOfElements**, **Unflatten**, **View**, **Split**: Already correctly implemented in
  `mlx/backend/gpu/primitives.cpp` using proper GPU copy/reshape ops. No changes needed in
  the Vulkan-specific file.

- **Load** (`primitives.cpp` line ~1706): Was throwing `runtime_error` — fixed to `eval_cpu(inputs, out)`.
  On unified-memory (MoltenVK) the VMA buffer is CPU-accessible so the mmap reader writes directly.

- **Compiled** (`primitives.cpp` line ~1736): Was throwing `runtime_error` — fixed to
  `eval_cpu(inputs, outputs)`. `mx.compile()`-fused kernels now work (CPU-stream compilation
  is fully functional; GPU-stream compilation delegates and re-dispatches sub-ops).

### Test: Stage 23 (`tests/vulkan/test_stage23_shape_misc.py`)

- [x] NumberOfElements (GPU) — scalar product of axis sizes
- [x] Unflatten (GPU) — reshape one axis → multiple
- [x] View / dtype reinterpret (GPU) — float32 → uint32 byte-level reinterpret
- [x] Split basic (GPU) — 2-chunk split shape verification
- [x] Split numerical correctness — compare with numpy reference
- [x] Load round-trip (.npz) — mx.savez then mx.load
- [x] Compiled (mx.compile) — eager vs compiled numerical match

## Phase 12: Production Readiness Gaps (Identified 2026-03-02)

### Current Status (2026-03-02)
**Custom stage suite**: ~22/23 stages passing (only stage 14 test spec mismatch).
**Official MLX test suite** (`tests/test_ops.py`, `tests/test_array.py`): ~46% pass rate.
**Blocker**: MLX defaults to `bfloat16` for model weights — **zero BF16 shader support**.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (production impossible without these)

#### 1. BF16 Support in All Shaders ✅ COMPLETE
- MLX uses `mx.bfloat16` as default dtype for LLM/model weights
- Current: ALL BF16 ops silently fail / produce garbage (no shader BF16 path)
- Fix: Add `bf16.glsl` helper (pack/unpack as uint16), wire into `unary.comp`, `binary.comp`, `reduce.comp`, `matmul.comp`, `softmax.comp`, `normalization.comp`, `copy.comp`
- **Estimate**: 3-4 shader files, ~200 lines total
- [x] `kernels/bf16.glsl` — `unpackBfloat2x16` / `packBfloat2x16` helpers
- [x] `unary.comp` — BF16 input/output path (alongside existing f16 path)
- [x] `binary.comp` — BF16 arithmetic paths (broadcast strides already supported)
- [x] `reduce.comp` — BF16 accumulation (accumulate in f32, write back as bf16)
- [x] `softmax.comp` — BF16 input/output (via C++ wrappers)
- [x] `matmul.comp` — BF16 operands (accumulate in f32)
- [x] `normalization.comp` — BF16 layer_norm/rms_norm (via C++ wrappers)
- [x] **Softmax BF16 copy back fix** (2026-03-03): Fixed bug where `Softmax::eval_gpu` temp buffer wasn't copied back to output, causing BF16 softmax to return zeros. Added `copy_gpu(*temp_out, out, CopyType::General, stream())` after barrier.

#### 2. Multi-axis Gather on GPU
- Transformers use `mx.take(x, idx)` with non-trivial index shapes (2D/3D)
- Current: 1D single-axis gather works; multi-axis falls to CPU
- Fix: Extend `indexing.comp` INDEX_GATHER_GEN to handle multi-dim index tensors
- [ ] Detect multi-axis gather in `Gather::eval_gpu`
- [ ] Pass `idx_shape[]` + `idx_strides[]` in push constants (extend IndexPushConst)
- [ ] Shader: flatten ND index → source offset using `src_shape` and `idx_shape`
- **Note**: Must bump `kPipelineCacheVersion` when IndexPushConst layout changes

#### 3. Sort > 256 Elements (Radix Sort)
- Current: sort > 256 falls to CPU (bitonic sort limited to 256 SMEM)
- Fix: Implement 2-pass radix sort in `sort.comp` for arbitrary sizes
- [ ] Pass 1: Per-workgroup 4-bit radix digit histogram
- [ ] Pass 2: Prefix sum over histograms (reuse scan.comp approach)
- [ ] Pass 3: Scatter to sorted positions
- Alternatively: merge sort using ping-pong buffers (simpler, good enough for n≤4M)

---

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY (needed for 90%+ official test pass rate)

#### 4. Numerical Equivalence Test Suite
- No automated GPU-vs-CPU comparison tests
- [ ] Create `tests/vulkan_equivalence.py`
- [ ] Test all 28 unary ops, 18 binary ops, reduce (all axes), matmul (8 sizes), softmax, normalization
- [ ] Tolerance: `atol=1e-4` for float32, `atol=1e-2` for float16
- [ ] Add to CI workflow

#### 5. Fix Official MLX Test Suite (46% → 90%+)
- Last audit: `test_array.py` 52/69 pass, `test_ops.py` 41/134 pass
- Key failure categories:
  - Missing GPU primitives / Incorrect Implementations: `test_add`, `test_arange_corner_cases_cast`, `test_arange_overload_dispatch`, `test_array_equal`, `test_bitwise_ops`, `test_clip`, `test_complex_ops`, `test_complex_power`, `test_conjugate`, `test_cos`, `test_divmod`, `test_dynamic_slicing`
  - `test_diag` induces a Python `Segmentation fault` via Apple's standard library extensions.
- [ ] Profile failures with `python -m pytest tests/test_ops.py -v 2>&1 | grep FAIL`
- [ ] `test_add` (Missing arithmetic pipeline/corner case precision issue)
- [ ] `test_arange_corner_cases_cast`, `test_arange_overload_dispatch` (Data type casting failures)
- [ ] `test_array_equal` (Shape equality broadcasting failures)
- [ ] `test_bitwise_ops` (Unimplemented/failing integer binary operations)
- [ ] `test_clip`
- [ ] `test_complex_ops`, `test_complex_power`, `test_conjugate` (Complex numbering evaluation)
- [ ] `test_cos` (Missing trigonometric precision)
- [ ] `test_divmod`
- [ ] `test_dynamic_slicing`

#### 6. Scan > 1024 Multi-pass GPU
- Current: scan_size > 1024 falls to CPU
- Fix: 3-pass Hillis-Steele: (1) scan within blocks, (2) scan of block sums, (3) propagate
- [ ] Extend `scan.comp` with second pass dispatch when `scan_size > 1024`
- [ ] Dispatch logic in `Scan::eval_gpu`: choose 1-pass or 3-pass based on size

#### 7. Stage 14 Test Spec Update
- 3 tests expect `RuntimeError` for sort >256, but code now silently CPU-fallbacks
- [ ] Update `test_stage14_sort.py`: verify correct results from CPU fallback path
- [ ] Extend to test sort correctness for sizes 512, 1024

---

### 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY (nice-to-have for completeness)

#### 8. Workgroup Tuning via VkSpecializationInfo
- Infrastructure complete (subgroup size queried at init)
- Shaders hardcode `local_size_x=256`
- [ ] Wire `preferred_workgroup_size_` through `VkSpecializationInfo` per-pipeline
- [ ] Tune `matmul.comp` tile for AMD 64-wide wavefronts vs NVIDIA 32-wide

#### 9. GatherMM / BlockMaskedMM GPU Implementation
- Currently throw on GPU stream (CPU stream works)
- Needed for sparse attention in transformer models
- [ ] `GatherMM::eval_gpu`: implement gather + fused matmul shader
- [ ] `BlockMaskedMM::eval_gpu`: block-sparse matmul with mask

#### 10. mx.compile() GPU Fusion (JIT Kernel Fusion)
- Currently: CPU fallback; individual sub-ops dispatch to GPU separately
- Ideal: fuse elementwise chains into single SPIR-V kernel via shaderc JIT
- [ ] Implement `Compiled::eval_gpu` with shaderc JIT compilation
- [ ] Cache fused kernels by op-graph hash

#### 11. fast::Quantize GPU Shader Path
- Currently: inline CPU on VMA buffers (due to VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST with pending semaphores)
- Root cause: command buffer submission race when `random.normal` semaphores are in-flight
- [ ] Investigate `commit()` path for `has_sems=1, op_count=0` case
- [ ] GPU shader path for dequantize (eliminate CPU sync overhead)
